(** Spec takes inspiration from OCaml's property-based testing library Monolith.
    The idea is that the programmer describes the function specification through
    the set of generators from QCheck and a printer.

    Examples:

    - Addition specification:

    {[
      let add = (+)
      let spec_add = Spec.(int ^> int ^>> int)
    ]}

    - List sum specification:

    {[
      let sum = List.fold_left ( + )
      let spec_sum = int ^>> int
    ]}
 *)

module Gen : sig
  include module type of QCheck.Gen
end

(** ['a gen] is used to generate random values inside {!spec}.
    QCheck combinators are available using [Spec.Gen]. *)
type 'a gen = 'a QCheck.Gen.t

(** ['a printer] is used to store randomly generated values *)
type 'a printer = 'a -> string

(** ['a spec] combines an ['a gen] and a printer *)
type 'a spec = { gen : 'a gen; printer : 'a printer }

(** [t] is the specification type, describing a function.
    Thus [t] declaration must end with {! (^>>) }. *)
type ('fn, 'r) t =
  | Result : 'a printer -> ('a, 'a) t
  | Arrow : 'a spec * ('fn, 'r) t -> ('a -> 'fn, 'r) t

(** [int] specification *)
val int : int spec

(** [list spec] creates a list spec for [spec] *)
val list : 'a spec -> 'a list spec

(** [(^>) x y] combines spec [x] and [y] to create [x -> y] *)
val ( ^> ) : 'a spec -> ('b, 'c) t -> ('a -> 'b, 'c) t

(** [(^>>) x res] combines a specification and printer for the result type *)
val ( ^>> ) : 'a spec -> 'b printer -> ('a -> 'b, 'b) t
